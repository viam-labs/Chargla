### About Chargla:
Chargla is a mobile robot prototype test platform for autonomously inserting a Tesla charger into the charge port. It is a collaboration between Viam Inc and Simone Giertz.
Chargla has the following key modules:-
* Pre-fabricated base with Mecanum wheels to allow rotational and lateral motion for aligning the charger with the port
* Lift feature for adjusting the height of the charger so as to compensate for uneven ground or variability in tire pressure
* Pivoting feature using a parallelogram-based 4 bar linkage; for adjusting the charger angle for correct alignment with the port
* Insertion actuator for inserting and retracting the charger into the port receptacle
* Switch actuator for enabling the port actuation features to open/close the port door and enable charging
* Soft mounting system for allowing compliance of the charger during insertion to account for small misalignments
* Laser guide and dual camera system for autonomously tracking the charging port

### CAD data:
CAD part files are in Solidworks (2021 edition) SLDPRT format. The full assembly is in STEP format - note that the Mecanum wheel/motor assemblies are excluded since this CAD is available from GrabCAD (refer to BOM for link).
